#  Initial Planning / Schedule Record

* _8:00 - 9:00 --> Decided on topic._

#### I chose to work on my CSS skills today. In the Java/Android track so far we only explored CSS in the intro unit. While an app/site should have sound backend logic that provides useful services to the user, if the frontend is unsightly / not user friendly then it is kind of irrelevant how good the services are. I think styling pages is a weakness for me, so I would like to spend the day working on CSS. It may not be something I need to know for a job in the future, but for my solo projects I work on in the future (at and beyond Epicodus), I think it would be beneficial to be more skilled with CSS than I am now.

* _9:00 - 10:30 --> Watch Epicodus suggested videos and read suggested articles (weekend and Monday of CSS course)._

* _10:30 = 12:00 --> Work on 1st copy exercise from wk 1 of CSS course._

* _13:00 - 16:00 --> Work on 2nd copy exercise from wk 1 of CSS course._
